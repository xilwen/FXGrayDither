# Assignment 2 : Generating Sounds of Different Pitch Tones

## The format designed for the input text file of musical notes
The program is designed to read the input file line by line, and every line should be written in the format:  

        <track_header><note_data>*  
<b>track_header</b> should be "alto:" or "basso".  
<b>note_data</b> contains octave, note(sharp or normal) and length. User may have many note_data in one line to compose a melody. <b>note_data</b> should be expressed as follows:

        <octave(0~5)><sharp(+)/normal(_)><note(1~7)>(<length(double)>)

Sample input file and results can be found at https://github.com/xilwen/multimedia-systems-assignments/tree/master/Assignment2/test .

## The way to set up and run this program
This program requires Java Runtime with JavaFX supported to run properly.  
Runnable JAR are available at https://github.com/xilwen/multimedia-systems-assignments/releases/tag/A2 .

Waveform of the output of sample input (generated by Audacity), the first one is generated tonal sound, the second is the result of Frequency Modulation with f = 100, third one is f = 500, the fourth is f = 800.

## Problem(s) encountered
* Preview sound will stop unexpectedly since Java automatically perform Garbage Collection.   Move the MediaPlayer varible to be a class field solved the problem.
 

## Discussions and Summaries
Do frequency modulation with higher frequency will result in higher tone of the output file, and lower frequency will result in lower tone.

## What I have learned in this assignment
* How to generate sound using sine wave
* Format of WAV file
* RandomAccessFile feature in Java*
